# OCR by Iron Minds
Currently shows the image processing and a neural network learning the XOR
function.

## Usage
### Build
Run make to compile this project to bin/ocr.
Furthermore, there are clean and run rules to remove temporary files and run
the program without any argument.

### Run
For the moment, only demos are available for the image segmentation and the
neural network parts :

```sh
# Image part
bin/ocr img
# Network part
bin/ocr net
```
## Structure
+ README - What you're currently reading.

+ AUTHORS - Who we are.

+ res - Folder for the ressources of the project. For now it's the reference
        images.

+ src - Folder for the source of the project. It contains our code :
  main.c = The all target, the program.
  
  ai.c = Contains the AI functions.
  ai.h = Header for the ai.c with explanations of the functions.
  
  data.c = Contains the dataset functions.
  data.h = Header for the data.c with explanations of the functions.

  error.h = Used for detecting errors.
  
  gui.c = Contains the GUI functions.
  gui.h = Header for the gui.c with explanations of the functions.
  
  ocr.c = Contains the wrapper functions.
  ocr.h = Header for the ocr.c with explanations of the functions.
  
  save.c = Contains the saving functions.
  save.h = Header for the save.c with explanations of the functions.
  
  train.c = Contains the training functions.
  train.h = Header for the train.c with explanations of the functions.
  
  matrix.c = Contains the matrix functions.
  matrix.h = Header for the matrix.c with explanations of the functions.

  tools.c = Contains all the tools for image manipulations.
  tools.h = Header for the tools.c with explanations of the functions.

  initializer.c = Contains the functions for initializing matrices.
  initializer.h = Header for the initializer.c.

  layers.h/.c = Neural network layers.

  losses.h/.c = Loss functions (layers) for the neural net.

  optimizer.h/.c = Neural network optimizer
    (updates weights of the network).

+ bin - Folder that contains the executable file (can be removed by using the
        make clean command).

+ obj - Folder that contains the obj. files (can be removed by using the make
        clean command).

+ Makefile - File for GNU Make.
        Simply use the command make to compile the code.

### Training
To build the dataset use make dataset (before make).

Some requirements are necessary, use this command to install :

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also have to enable execution of the main script

```sh
chmod +x data/generate.sh
```
