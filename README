# OCR by Iron Minds
Currently shows the image processing and a neural network learning the XOR
function.

## Usage
### Build
Run make to compile this project to bin/ocr.
Furthermore, there are clean and run rules to remove temporary files and run
the program without any argument.

### Run
For the moment, only demos are available for the image segmentation and the
neural network parts :

```sh
# Image part
bin/ocr img
# Network part
bin/ocr net
```
## Structure
+ README - What you're currently reading.

+ AUTHORS - Who we are.

+ res - Folder for the ressources of the project. For now it's the reference
        images.

+ src - Folder for the source of the project. It contains our code :
  main.c = The all target, the program.

  matrix.c = Contains the matrix functions.
  matrix.h = Header for the matrix.c with explanations of the functions.

  tools.c = Contains all the tools for image manipulations.
  tools.h = Header for the tools.c with explanations of the functions.

  initializer.c = Contains the functions for initializing matrices.
  initializer.h = Header for the initializer.c.

  layers.h/.c = Neural network layers.

  losses.h/.c = Loss functions (layers) for the neural net.

  optimizer.h/.c = Neural network optimizer
    (updates weights of the network).

+ bin - Folder that contains the executable file (can be removed by using the
        make clean command).

+ obj - Folder that contains the obj. files (can be removed by using the make
        clean command).

+ Makefile - File for GNU Make.
        Simply use the command make to compile the code.

### Training
To build the dataset use make dataset (before make).
